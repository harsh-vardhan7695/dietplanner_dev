# ✅ Dietary Restrictions Fix - Test Results

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **UI Field Clarity**
- **Before**: "Food Allergies/Intolerances" was confusing for dietary choices
- **After**: 
  - "Medical Food Allergies/Intolerances" - for actual medical conditions
  - "Dietary Preferences & Restrictions" - for lifestyle choices like vegetarian/vegan

### 2. **Backend Prompt Improvements**
- **Before**: Generic prompts that sometimes ignored restrictions
- **After**: Explicit instructions to STRICTLY FOLLOW dietary preferences
- Added double-check requirements for vegetarian/vegan compliance

### 3. **Parameter Mapping**
- **Before**: Unclear data flow from UI to backend
- **After**: Clear separation between medical allergies and dietary preferences
